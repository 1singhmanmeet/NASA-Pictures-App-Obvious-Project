# NASA-Pictures-App-Obvious-Project

As mentioned in the [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1az0Wa2cFChys--Xg4_MJwOj8pcTmlrmsJSKvurJyzwc/edit#) the app has two screens:

### 1. Images Grid Screen

This is the home screen. When it launches, show a scrollable grid of pictures starting with the latest images first. When the user taps on an image that open the image detail screen.

### 2. Image Detail Screen

This screen displays the full size image along with the metadata like title, description, etc. The user can also swipe through images.

### Offline support

If there is no internet available user can view the images if they are stored previously.

Thanks to Obvious, it was nice project. Even though i was quite busy, I managed to do the basic things.
